human-centered ai
	- systems that work for human, not replace and replicate them
	- user-centered
	- community-centered
	- society-centred
	- needs interdisciplinary teams
		- needs to be integrated from the start

	- example:
		- self driving cars
			- user-centered
				- driver
			- community-centered
				- drivers of other autnomous and non-autonomous cars, pedestrians, cyclists, etc.
			- society-level
				- city or region


	who does  hci?
	- multidisciplinary field
	- machine side: 
		- computer graphics , operating systems, pls, development, environments, networking, software engineering, mobility, and engr.
	- increasingly: 
		- industrial, product design, digital media, and processing, infosense, robotics
	- on the human side:
		- psychology and kinesiology
			- cognitive, perceptual , and motor behavior
			- human capabilities to use and learn machines
		- sociology and anthropology
			- group and cultural behavior
		- art and graphic + tactile design
			- visual design principles and aesthetics


	what makes it hci
		- joint performance of tasks by human and computers
		- structure of communication between human/computer and human/human meditated by computers

	HCI process
	- stages of design
	- design stages have different goals
	- evaluatoin tools to support those goals
	- identifying stakeholders
	

	where does the hci process start
	- identifying human activities needing better support
		- designing a system that provides what they really need
	- specifiying usability ; utility; user exp and deploying it for usefulness

	process stages and their goals
		- predesign : understand the problem
		- early design: explore design space
		- mid design: develop the chosen approach
		- late design: integrate and start to deploy
		- always: evaluate and prototype
	
	iteration: the most key feature
	- its hard to predict or perfectly model:
		- people - diversity in abilities, needs, motivations...
		- contexts of use
		- how they want to do their taks/activity
		- how they will view your interface
	
	-> designer's own progressive understanding of issues

	designing for people is not exactly like building a bridge

	evaluation tools: 

	roadmap to evaluation types
	- predesign
		- ethnography
		- observation, interview, focus gropus
		- questionnaires, surveys

	- early design
		- interviews, focus groups, observation
		- questionnaires, survey
		- contextual inquiry & work modeling
		- task analysis, task / cognitive

	- mid desing / late design
	
	who are the stakeholders
	- anyone who has a reason to care about the product

	- user: convenience, functionality
	- boss: price, worker efficiency
	- developer : ease of development, deadlines
	- manufacturer

	bowing to reality
	- deadlines
	- budgets
	

	attitudes towards design
	- technology-centered design
		- design decisions guided by technology
	- prevalent atitude in real world because
		- tech is fun
		- making novel things is engaging for the designer
		- seems like it hsould work well, or looks cool people often buy it too
