problem : stressing out when doing acads
	- when the topic does not interests her

structure : 
	- primer
		- ease the participant in the session
		- make participant comfy
		- introduce oneself
		- indicate what you hope to achieve during the interview
		- discuss confidentiality
	- transition
		- stop and explain what will happen during the session
		- let the user know that you will watch while they go about their work and 
		you will interrupt whenever you see something interesting
		- if it is a bad time to interrupt, they should communicate
	- contextual interview
		- watch and learn; stop and initiate discussion
		- be aware of external resources being used
		- ask about standard steps vs extraneous
		- explain your interpretation
	- wrap-up
		- conclusion
		- ask final clarifying questions
		- review your notes and summarize

questions:
	- what's your standard working pattern / procedure when doing academic work
		- before 
		- during
		- after
	- what are the topics that interest you and the topics that less interest you
	- how's your typical working environment
		- place
		- device
		- time
	- observe behavior and ask why if interesting
