digital -digital conversion
- represented digital data using digital signals
- involves 3 techniques:
	- line coding
	- block coding
	- scrambling
- line coding is always needed; block coding and scrambling may or may not be needed

- line coding
	- data element
		- smallest entity that can represent a piece of info (bit)
	- signal element
		- shortest unit timewise of a digital signal
	- r = number of data elements / signal elements


	- data rate (bit rate)
		- number of bits sent in 1 sec
	- signal rate ( pulse rate, modulation rate, baud rate)
		- number of signal elements sent in 1 second (baud)
	- goal: increase data rate while decreaseing signal rate
	- S = c * N * (1/r) 

	- process of converting dgital data ( strings of 0 and 1 ) into digital signal
	- considerations for choosing good coding scheme
		- effective bandwidth
			- finite compared to absolute bandwidth
			- baud rate determines the required bandwidth
			- bandiwdth is proportional to baud rate

		- baseline wandering
			- receiver calculates a running average of the received signal power - baseline
			- incoming signal is evaluated against baseline
			- long sequence of 0 and 1 can cause a drift in the baseline
			- line coding scheme must prevent this
		- direct current (DC) components
			- very low (near 0) frequencies created by the spectrum when digital signal is constant for a while
			- some systems cannot pass low frequencies
			- some systems use electrical copuling
			- no DC component is desired

		- self-synchronization
			- digital signal includes timing information in the data being transmitted
		- built in error detection
			- signal has built in error detectoin
		- immunity to noise and interference
		- complexity
	- line coding schemes
		- unipolar - all signal levels are above or below time axis (nrz)
			- non-return to zero
			- 1 - positive volt, 0 - zero
			- scheme is prone to baseline wandering ; simple but energy inefficient
		- polar 
			- nrzl (level)
				- level of voltage determines value of bit
			- nrzi (invert)
				- change or lack of change in the level of the voltage determines the value of the bit ( 0 - no change)
		- bipolar
		- multilevel
		- multitransition - mlt
