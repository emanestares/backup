switch
- temporary connection

switched connection
- circuity switching
- packet switching
- message switching

switching and tcp/io layers
- physical layer
	- circuit switching
- data link layer
	- packet switching (virtual approach)
- network layer
	- packet switching ( virtual / datagram)
- applicatoin layer
	- message switching

circuit -switched network
- set of switch connected by physical links
- connectin between two stations is a dedicated path made of one or more links
- only one channel in a link is used
- each link is normally divided into n channels by FDM or TDM
- phases: 
	- connection setup
	- data transfer
	- connection teardown

- inefficient
	- dedicated link can be unused
- minimal delay
- takes place at the physical layer
- resources to be used must be resereved
- data transferred are a continuous flow
- no addressing involved in the data transfer

packet switched network
- messages are divided into packets: fixed or variable size
- no resource allocation for a packet
- resources are allocated on demand; FCFS
- 2 types: 
	- datagram networks
	- virtual-circuit networks

- datagram
	- each packet is treated independently of all others
	- datagram switching done at the network layer
	- datagrams may arrive out of order or get lost
	- connectionless - no information on state of connection is save
	- uses a routing table that is based on the destination address
	- routing tables 
		- dynamic and are updated periodically
	- header contains address
	- destination address in the header of a packet in a diagram network remains the same throughout the journey of the packet
	- efficient
		- resource are allocated when there are packets to be transferred
	- more delay 
		- waiting time in switches; 
		- delay is not uniform
		- total delay : 3  * transmission time + 3 * propagation time +2 * waiting time


- virtual circuit network
	- cros between circuit switched and datagram network
	- with connection setup and teardown phases
	- resources can be allocated during the setpu phase or on demand
	- packetized data with address in header (local jurisdiction only)
	- packet follows the same path established
	- implemented in the data link layer

	- source or a destination needs to have a global address - used to create VCI
	- virtual circuit identifier
		- small number that has only switch scope (between two switches)
	- data transfer phase
		- all switches need to have a table entry ( in simplest form has 4 columns)

	- setup phase
		- setup request 
			- frame is sent from the source to the destination; switch acts as a packet switch (routing table is different from switching table)
		- acknowledgement
			- special frame (ack frame ) completes the entries
	- efficiency
		- all packets belonging to the same source and dest travel 
	- total delay = 3 * transmission time + 3* 

structure of a circuit switch
- space division switch 
	- paths in the circuit are separated spatially
	- crossbar
	- multistage
- time division switch 
	- used tdm
	- time slot


-crossbar 
	- connects n inputs to m outputs to a crosspoint
- multistage 
	- combines crossbar siwtches in several stages
- time-slot interchange(tsi):
	- consists of random access memory with several memory locations
- time space time
	- tsi - crossbar - tsi


structure of a packet switch
- input ports
- output ports
- routing processor
- switching fabric
	- crossbar
	- banyan
	- batcher-banyan switch

- banyan switch
	- multistage switch with microswitches at each stage that route the packets based on the output port represented by a binary switch
